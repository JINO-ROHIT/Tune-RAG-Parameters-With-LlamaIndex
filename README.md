# Tune RAG Parameters and track with Mlflow

This project shows how to tune different parameters of a RAG application(chunk size, top k etc) and track all the metrics, parameters and artifacts using mlflow. This helps to compare different techniques and iterate quickly over experiments.


## How to run

```bash
python tune_rag.py
```
